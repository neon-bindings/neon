# 2024

**2024:** Test Neon with Rust 2024 Edition

This project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

## Building 2024

Building 2024 requires a [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).

To run the build, run:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This command uses the [@neon-rs/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neon-rs/cli) utility to assemble the binary Node addon from the output of `cargo`.

## Exploring 2024

After building 2024, you can explore its exports at the Node console:

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run build
$ node
> require('.').hello()
'hello node'
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`

Installs the project, including running `npm run build`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the Node addon (`index.node`) from source, generating a release build with `cargo --release`.

Additional [`cargo build`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html) arguments may be passed to `npm run build` and similar commands. For example, to enable a [cargo feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html):

```
npm run build -- --feature=beetle
```

#### `npm run debug`

Similar to `npm run build` but generates a debug build with `cargo`.

#### `npm run cross`

Similar to `npm run build` but uses [cross-rs](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) to cross-compile for another platform. Use the [`CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#buildtarget) environment variable to select the build target.

#### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests by calling `cargo test`. You can learn more about [adding tests to your Rust code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html) from the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
