error: Async functions in classes must take `self` by value, not `&self` or `&mut self`. This is required because async functions capture `self` in the Future, which must be `'static` for spawning.

  = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `neon::class` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider annotating `Example` with `#[derive(Default)]`
