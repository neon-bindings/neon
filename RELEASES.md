# `cargo-cp-artifact`

`0.1.9` supports a [breaking change in `cargo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/13867) that converts artifact names from `kebab-case` to `snake_case`.

# Version 1.1.0

## Continued Commitment to Compatibility

Our strong commitment to compatibility since the 1.0 release remains unchanged. New functionality
that has not yet stabilized is published under feature flags, so the only breaking changes that we
expect to publish are those that affect the unstable features, or, as always, safety bugfixes.

## Version 1.1.0

# Version 1.0.0

## Commitment to Compatibility

The release of Neon 1.0 marks our commitment to backwards-compatibility: starting with 1.0.0, Neon users can be confident that future **upgrades to Neon 1.x versions should never require code changes** (with the possible exception of safety bugfixes, which we expect to be rare). We also do not anticipate releasing new major versions often and do not have any plans to do so for now.

## Breaking Changes

* Remove the generic parameter from `JsFunction` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/989)
* `JsArray::new` takes a `usize` instead of a `u32` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/988)
* Made `Context::global` read a key and added `Context::global_object` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/987)
* Deprecated feature flags were removed

## Bug fixes

* Fix `unhandledRejection` with `JsPromise::to_future` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/1008)
* Typo in `cargo-cp-artifact` help (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/998)
* Typo in README (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/1012)

## Other

https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/1010

* Relaxed error behavior on missing Node-API symbols. Neon will panic on first use instead of aborting the process at module load time.
* Bumped dependency versions
* Changed to edition 2021
* Updated support matrix to Node 18, 20, and 21

# Version 1.0.0-alpha.4

Patch to enable new features flags in docs.rs.

# Version 1.0.0-alpha.3

## Breaking Changes

* Removed `Managed` trait

## Improvements

* Added `JsBigInt` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/963).
* Added UTF-16 functions to `JsString` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/944).
* Relaxed `Send` constraints (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/979)
* Lifecycle support for 32-bit (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/977)
* Added `sys` feature (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/970)

## Bug Fixes

* Fix a scope leak in release builds (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/952).

## Docs

* Examples added for many types ((https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/942)).

### `cargo-cp-artifact`

`0.1.8` fixes sending additional arguments on Windows (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/972).

# Version 1.0.0-alpha.2

## Breaking Changes

### `neon::object::This`

https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/918

Trait [`neon::object::This`](https://docs.rs/neon/latest/neon/object/trait.This.html) has been removed. `This` was primarily added for use with the `declare_types!` macro to generate classes. The macro was removed and `This` is no longer needed. Additionally, the `This` argument on `JsFunction` was found to be _invalid_ because it asserted at compile time a type for `this` that could change at runtime. (Note that this was _not_ unsound because the type would be checked by Node-API and result in a `panic`.)

### `JsFunction::this`

https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/918

`JsFunction::this` was changed to perform a downcast and be _fallible_. This is in line with similar APIs (e.g., `Object::get`). Additionally, an infallible version, `JsValue::this_value` was added that does _not_ perform a downcast.

### Added Feature flag for external buffers

https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/937

Electron began using [pointer compression](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage) on JavaScript values that is incompatible with external buffers. As a preventative measure, `JsArrayBuffer::external` and `JsBuffer::external` have been placed behind a feature flag that warns of Electron incompatibility.

## Improvements

* Lifetimes were relaxed on `execute_scoped` to allow valid code to compile. (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/919)
* Added a `from_slice` helper on `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)
* `JsTypedArray` construction and type aliases (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a panic on VM shutdown when using `Channel` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/934)
* Type tags were added to `JsBox` to prevent undefined behavior when multiple native add-ons are used (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/907)

## Docs

* Significantly improved documentation of `TypedArray` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/909)
* Removed unused values in `Channel` docs (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/925)

### `cargo-cp-artifact`

`0.1.7` includes a fix to unlink `.node` files before copying to address common code signing errors on macOS (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/921).

# Version 1.0.0-alpha.1

Pre-release of a major milestone for Neon. 1.0.

## Breaking Changes

### Major

* Removed the legacy backend; only Node-API is supported going forward (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/881)
* Removed `neon::result::JsResultExt` in favor of more general `neon::result::ResultExt` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/904)

### Minor

* Length APIs (`argument`, `argument_ops`, `len`) use `usize` instead of `i32` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/889)
* Deprecate feature flags for accepted RFCs (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/872)
* `neon::meta::version` returns `semver@1` version instead of `0.9` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/912)

## Features

* Add `Object.freeze` and `Object.seal` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/891)
* Futures RFC (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/872) Implementation (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/874)
  - Await `JoinHandle` from sending an event on a `Channel`
  - Adapt `JsPromise` to `JsFuture`
* API for thread-local data (i.e., instance data) (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/902)
* Add Object::call_with() convenience method to call a method on an object (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/879)

## Bug Fixes

* Relax the lifetime constraints on `TypedArray` borrows (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/877)
* Allowing missing symbols at load time to support [bun](https://bun.sh) (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/914)
* Prevent a panic when an async event is called after the JavaScript runtime has stopped (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/913)
* Fix a soundness hole in `JsArrayBuffer::external` and `JsBuffer::external` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/897)

## Docs

* Fixed mistake in `Object::get` docs (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/903)
* Fixed link in README to migration guide (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/895)

## Internal

* Moved `cargo-cp-artirfact` into the monorepo (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/905)
* Decreased the size of the Neon build matrix (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/893)
* Removed scope abstraction from legacy backend (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/888)
* Improved the monorepo structure of neon (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/884)

# Version 0.10.1

Fix a soundness hole in `JsArrayBuffer::external`
and `JsBuffer::external` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/897).

Thanks to [@Cassy343](https://github.com/Cassy343) for finding the [issue](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/issues/896)!

In previous versions of Neon, it was possible to create a `JsArrayBuffer` or `JsBuffer` that references data without the `'static` lifetime.

```rust
pub fn soundness_hole(mut cx: FunctionContext) -> JsResult<JsArrayBuffer> {
    let mut data = vec![0u8, 1, 2, 3];

    // Creating an external from `&mut [u8]` instead of `Vec<u8>` since there is a blanket impl
    // of `AsMut<T> for &mut T`
    let buf = JsArrayBuffer::external(&mut cx, data.as_mut_slice());

    // `buf` is still holding a reference to `data`!
    drop(data);

    Ok(buf)
}
```

# Version 0.10

* [Soundness] [Make `JsValue` types `!Copy`](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/832)
* [Soundness] [Tag `Root`](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/847) with instance id
* `create-neon` no longer [leaves partial project on disk](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/840)
* Fix legacy backend on [Electron and Windows](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/785)
* [FreeBSD support](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/856) on legacy backend

## Internal Improvements

* Replace Electron tests [with Playwright](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/835)
* Re-organize Neon into an [npm workspace](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/852)

# Version 0.9.1

* Expose the `Finalize` trait as `neon::types::Finalize` so that docs are visible
* Improved docs and build scripts in `create-neon` to make release builds more
  discoverable (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/771)
* Update `nan` to fix an Electron 13 incompatibility (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/778)

# Version 0.9.0

## Performance

`Channel`, formerly `EventQueue`, are now cloneable. Clones share a backing queue to take advantage of an [optimization](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/38506) in Node threadsafe functions. Additionally, when specifying Node API 6 or higher (`napi-6`), calling `cx.channel()` will return a shared queue (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/739).

The change may cause a performance regression in some pathological use cases (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/issues/762).

## Deprecation

`EventQueue` and `EventQueueError` have been renamed to `Channel` and `ChannelError` respectively to clarify their function and similarity to Rust channels. The types are available as deprecated aliases (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/752).

## Docs

* Document error causes for `Channel::try_send` docs (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/767)
* Document `neon::object` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/740)

## Fixes

* Fix usage of a removed API in legacy buffers (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/769)

# Version 0.8.3

* Fix crash caused by non-thread safety in napi_threadsafefunction on early termination (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/744)
* Fix memory leak in `Root` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/750)

# Version 0.8.2

* More docs improvements
* Added a deprecation warning to `neon new` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/722)

# Version 0.8.1

* Fix `legacy-backend` for Node 16 (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/715)
* Various docs improvements

# Version 0.8.0

## Fixes

* `as_slice` and `as_mut_slice` properly handle a `null` pointer from an empty buffer (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/681)
* Global drop queue added to avoid panics on N-API 6+ when dropping a `Root` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/700)

## Features

* Added `neon::reflect::eval` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/692)
* Added `create-neon` for creating an N-API project (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/690)
* Added details to the `README.md` generated by `create-neon` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/697)

## Improvements

* Switched N-API tests to `cargo-cp-artifact` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/687)
* Added `impl<T: Finalize> Finalize for Option<T>` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/680)
* Added a N-API migration guide (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/685)

## Housekeeping

* Lint fixes (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/609)
* Lint CI enforcement and `cargo fmt` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/698)

# Version 0.7.1

### Features

* Added `JsDate` to N-API backend (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/639)
* Implement `JsBuffer::unitialized` for N-API backend (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/664)

### Fixes

* Do not panic if a `Root` is leaked after the event loop has stopped (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/677)
* Stubs for features that will not be implemented in the N-API backend are removed (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/663)
* Fix doc URL link (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/663)

# Version 0.7.0

## N-API

### Version Selection

Neon supports a large number of different Node versions which may have different N-API requirements. Neon now supports selecting the minimum required N-API version required by a module. For example, for N-API Version 4:

```toml
neon = { version = "0.7", default-features = false, features = ["napi-4"] }
```

If the Neon module is loaded in an older version of Node that does not support that N-API version, a `panic` message will inform the user.

### Threadsafe Functions

A prerelease version of `EventQueue` for calling into the main JavaScript thread from Rust threads can be enabled with the `event-queue-api` feature flag. The API is considered unstable and may change in the future until the [RFC](https://github.com/neon-bindings/rfcs/pull/32) is merged.

# Version 0.6.0

The `cx.try_catch(..)` API has been updated to return `T: Sized` instead of `T: Value` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/631). This API is strictly more powerful and allows users to return both JavaScript and Rust values from `try_catch` closures.

## N-API

* N-API symbols are now loaded dynamically (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/646)
* Build process for N-API is greatly simplified by leveraging dynamic loading (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/647)

# Version 0.5.3

## Bug Fixes

Upgrade `node-gyp` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/623)
* Fix Windows Node 15
* Fix Apple M1

## Features

Added `neon::main` macro as a replacement for `register_module!` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/636)

## Known Issues

Builds occassionally fail with Windows, Node 15 and npm 7 (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/issues/642)

# Version 0.5.2

## CLI

Added support for [additional arguments](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/633) passed to `cargo build`. Resolves https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/issues/471.

```sh
neon build --release -- --features awesome
```

## N-API

* Improved [arguments performance](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/610)
* Add [redirect and `NPM_CONFIG_DISTURL`](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/620) support

# Version 0.5.1

## Performance

* `smallvec` is used for collecting arguments and yields a small performance gain when calling `JsFunction`

## Broader Support

Thanks to @staltz, neon now builds for both iOS and Android with [nodejs-mobile](https://github.com/JaneaSystems/nodejs-mobile).

# Version 0.5.0

_Re-publish_

Versions `0.4.1` and `0.4.2` included a breaking change in `neon-runtime`. At the time, this was considered acceptable because `neon-runtime` is considered an internal crate and not part of the public API. However, it was discovered, after publishing, that `neon-serde`, a commonly used crate in the `neon` ecosystem, contained a direct dependency on `neon-runtime`. In order to best support users, versions `0.4.1` and `0.4.2` were "yanked" and re-published as `0.5.0`.

Additionally, the team is working with the authors of `neon-serde` to remove the dependency on `neon-runtime` to prevent future issues.

## Bug Fixes

* Fix stack overflow in `DowncastError` `Display` impl (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/606)

# Version 0.4.2

_Unpublished / Yanked_

## Bug Fixes

* Fix memory leak and race condition in `EventHandler`

# Version 0.4.1

_Unpublished / Yanked_

## Features

### Try Catch

Added the `cx.try_catch` API of [RFC 29](https://github.com/neon-bindings/rfcs/pull/29). This feature is behind the `try-catch-api` feature flag.

## Bug Fixes

* Pass `async_context` to `node::MakeCallback` (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/498)
* Cache bust neon if node version changes (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/388)
* Fix debug builds in windows (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/400)
* Fix cross compiling architectures (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/491)
* Fix neon new hanging on Windows (https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/537)

## CI Improvements

The Neon Project now uses Github Actions thanks to @lhr0909! As part of this change, CI now runs on all of our supported platforms (macOS, Windows, linux) and Node versions.

# Version ✨0.4✨ 🎉

## `EventHandler` API

The [`EventHandler` API](https://github.com/neon-bindings/rfcs/blob/main/text/0025-event-handler.md) is a new feature for scheduling work on the javascript main thread from other threads. Big thanks to @geovie for the RFC and implementation.

This feature is currently _unstable_ and gated by a `event-handler-api` feature flag.

## Improvements

* New project template updated for Rust 2018

## Bug Fixes

* Workaround for nodejs/node-gyp#1933
* Docs build fixed
* Temporarily disable static tests which keep breaking CI

## N-API

* Context/Isolate threading
* Scopes
* Strings
* Primitive values (numbers, undefined, null, boolean)

# Version 0.3.3

Hot fix for `neon build` in projects with many dependencies.

# Version 0.3.2

## Bug fixes and Small Features

* Disable node module registration on test build, allowing `cargo test` to be used on neon modules
* Added support for alternate `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` locations (e.g., workspaces)
* Added macros to `neon::prelude` to improve ergonomics in Rust 2018
* Link `win_delay_hook` when building with `electron-build-env`, fixing Windows Electron
* Fixed missing `__cxa_pure_virtual` on Linux
* Copy native files into `OUT_DIR` and build there to fix `cargo publish` and follow best practices
* Eliminated `mem::uniitialized()` usage, reducing warnings and fixing an instance of undefined behavior

## Potentially Breaking

The macOS link arguments were moved from `neon-cli` to `neon-build`. This is more idiomatic, but makes `neon-build` _required_ for macOS builds where it was unnecessary before.

Since `neon-build` has been included in the project template since `0.1` this change was not deemed significant enough to warrant a major revision.

## N-API

Neon 0.3.2 lays the groundwork for the next major revision. Development of Neon against an ABI stable Node API (N-API) will occur on main.

* Added `legacy-runtime` and `n-api` feature flags for toggling neon runtime
* Moved the legacy runtime to `nodejs-sys` crate
* Stubbed required `n-api` implementation
* Added `feature` flag to `neon-cli` to help configuring `n-api` projects

# Version 0.3.1

* Build v0.3 project templates by default in the CLI

# Version 0.3

## Breaking Changes

* [Removed support for Node 6](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/420)

## Bug Fixes

* Correctly fail the build if [custom build command fails](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/421)
* Fix breaking changes with v8 [`GetFunction`](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/410)
* Moved `nan` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in [`neon-runtime`](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/367)
* Changed neon [crate type](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/358) from `dylib` to `cdylib`
* Ensure that neon module loading is [not optimized away](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/392)

## Improvements

* Added support for [`CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` environment variable](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/pull/411)
