# Contributing to Neon

Neon welcomes contribution from everyone. Here are some resources to help you join us!

## Contributions

### Issue reports

We welcome issues and aim to keep the barrier low. For clarity and efficiency, we created these simple issue templates:
 - [Bug Report](https://github.com/neon-bindings/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml&title=üêõ+%5BBUG%5D+-+<title>)
 - [Other](https://github.com/neon-bindings/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=default_issue.yml&title=%3Cissue+title%3E)

### Requests For Comments

If you would like to propose a design change or new feature for the Neon API or the `neon` command-line tool,
we encourage you to [submit an RFC](https://github.com/neon-bindings/rfcs)!

The [RFC process](https://github.com/neon-bindings/rfcs#the-process) has a little more overhead than filing an issue, but it's for the goal of allowing the Neon community to have a chance to vet design ideas and reach consensus. And even at that, we've deliberately kept the [RFC template](https://github.com/neon-bindings/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.yml&title=%3Ctitle%3E)
simple and open-ended.

### Good first bugs

Search our issue tracker for anything labeled **[beginner friendly](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22beginner+friendly%22)**.

**We are here to help you!** Join our Slack and send an at-mention to **@dherman** and we'll happily arrange
to help you get going and mentor you as much as you feel would be helpful.

## Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).
The maintainers of Neon personally promise to work actively to uphold that code of conduct.
We aim to foster a community that is welcoming, inclusive, empathetic, and kind.
If you share those goals and want to have a ton of fun playing with Rust and JS, we hope you will come be a part of our community!

## License

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as described in the [README](README.md), without any additional terms or conditions.
